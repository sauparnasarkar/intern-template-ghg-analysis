# Climate Change Trend Analysis and Forecasting

**IDEAS TIH Summer Internship 2026 | Mentor: Sauparna Sarkar**

---

## Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end analytical pipeline on open Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions data. The team ingests the OWID CO₂ dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, engineers time-series features, trains regression and forecasting models, and (optionally) assembles an interactive Streamlit dashboard. The focus is on classical ML and time-series methods applied to structured annual emissions data for 10 countries across 1990–2023.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sauparnasarkar/intern-template-ghg-analysis.git
cd intern-template-ghg-analysis
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the dataset
The OWID CO₂ dataset is not committed to this repository (it is ~50 MB). Download it once and save it to the `data/` folder:

```bash
curl -o data/owid-co2-data.csv \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv
```

Or download manually from: https://github.com/owid/co2-data

### 5. Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/ghg_analysis.ipynb
```

### 6. Run the Streamlit app (Week 6 stretch goal)
> **Prerequisite:** Complete Week 2 first so that `data/ghg_features.csv` exists.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Weekly Commit Schedule

Commit your notebook to GitHub at the end of every week using a clear message:

```bash
git add notebook/ghg_analysis.ipynb
git commit -m "Week 1: data loading, profiling, and EDA complete"
git push
```

| Week | Commit message convention |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1 | `Week 1: data loading, profiling, and EDA complete` |
| 2 | `Week 2: feature engineering complete, ghg_features.csv added` |
| 3 | `Week 3: regression models and comparison table complete` |
| 4 | `Week 4: ETS(A,Ad,N) Holt Damped forecasting complete` |
| 5 | `Week 5: scenario analysis complete` *(if applicable)* |
| 6 | `Week 6: notebook finalised, Streamlit app added` |
